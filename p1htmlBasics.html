        Traditionally, there have been middlemen who have been controlling the data. For instance, Facebook is the
        middleman between users and advertisers. Banks are middlemen between borrowers and lenders.
        <br> <br> The issue here is that the data is controlled by a central authority - Facebook and banks. They,
        therefore, control the prices and also technically own the data. In this scenario, all the power lies with a
        middleman and users have to trust them to remain ethical and continue to think about user interest. Blockchain
        was invented to make the data decentralized and trust minimized with any centralized party.
        <br> <br> In order to understand it better, let us talk about torrents. In torrents, no file is owned by a
        single person. It is a kind of “peer-to-peer” architecture where multiple copies of the file are present at
        multiple workstations/users. Therefore, no single person controls that file. This kind of architecture is highly
        scalable and fault-tolerant since there is no single point of failure.
        <br> <br> Blockchain essentially borrows the same idea: what if databases could be decentralized. This solves a
        lot of issues:

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can directly connect to a borrower without a middleman like a bank. You will get more profits</li> <br>
        <li>You can connect directly to advertisers to tell them the kind of ads that you like, without going through
            Facebook.</li>

    </ul>
