                Traditionally, there have been middlemen who have been controlling the data. For instance, Facebook is
                the
                middleman between users and advertisers. Banks are middlemen between borrowers and lenders.
                <br> <br> The issue here is that the data is controlled by a central authority - Facebook and banks.
                They,
                therefore, control the prices and also technically own the data. In this scenario, all the power lies
                with a
                middleman and users have to trust them to remain ethical and continue to think about user interest.
                Blockchain
                was invented to make the data decentralized and trust minimized with any centralized party.
                <br> <br> In order to understand it better, let us talk about torrents. In torrents, no file is owned by
                a
                single person. It is a kind of “peer-to-peer” architecture where multiple copies of the file are present
                at
                multiple workstations/users. Therefore, no single person controls that file. This kind of architecture
                is
                highly
                scalable and fault-tolerant since there is no single point of failure.
                <br> <br> Blockchain essentially borrows the same idea: what if databases could be decentralized. This
                solves a
                lot of issues:


            <ul>
                <li>You can directly connect to a borrower without a middleman like a bank. You will get more profits
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>You can connect directly to advertisers to tell them the kind of ads that you like, without going
                    through
                    Facebook.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            One of the well-known use cases of Blockchain is that of cryptocurrency which is a digital currency that
            isn’t
            controlled by any central authority. Similarly, we can use Blockchain for smart digital contracts where no
            middleman is verifying the contract.

            <br> <br> Blockchain is a peer- to- peer network of nodes that talk to each other. It’s a distributed
            network-
            different nodes are connected to another node (individual node). All the nodes on blockchain have a copy of
            the
            code
            and data on blockchain. All the data on blockchain is contained in a bundle of data called blocks. All the
            blocks
            chained together form a blockchain. All the nodes in the blockchain ensure that the distributed leger is
            unchangeable and safe.
            All the code on blockchain is contained in smart contracts. <br><br>Smart contracts are basically the
            programs
            that
            run on blockchain and they would be building block of blockchain.
            Smart contracts are written in the programming language called solidity. All the code in the smart contract
            i.e.,
            once deployed in blockchain is immutable(unchangeable). This is what makes the blockchain secure.
